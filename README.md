A One Time Password (OTP), which will be supplied to the visitor's email address, must be entered by the user after providing his or her email address. A success message will show up on the screen and a welcome message will be sent to the visitor's email address if the OTP is correctly input. A warning reading "Invalid OTP" will show up on the screen if the user inputs an invalid OTP. After their email address has been successfully validated, the user will start receiving random XKCD cartoons in mail indox every five minutes. The unsubscribe button in mail can be clicked by the user to stop receiving it.
